This project is a real-time object detection application built using React, Webcam, and TensorFlow's COCO-SSD model. It utilizes a webcam feed to detect objects in real-time and displays the results dynamically.

🛠️ Features
📷 Real-time Object Detection using the COCO-SSD model
⚡ Fast & Efficient inference using TensorFlow.js
🎥 Live Webcam Feed for instant detection
🎨 Styled UI with a responsive design
🚀 Technologies Used
React (Frontend framework)
Webcam.js (Capturing live video feed)
TensorFlow.js (Machine learning in the browser)
COCO-SSD (Pre-trained object detection model)
Tailwind CSS (For styling)

How It Works
The application loads the COCO-SSD model from TensorFlow.js.
Once the model is loaded, it processes frames from the webcam feed.
Objects detected in the frame are displayed in real time.
The UI dynamically updates as new objects are recognized.
